# The Cyber Shift: Analysing 5 Years of Cyber Attacks-
Career pivot in progress 💪: from tax compliance to data analytics 🔄

I'm now halfway through my government-funded Data Skills Bootcamp, building a strong foundation in 

- SQL 👨‍💻 
- Excel 📊
- Tableau 📈
- Power BI 📉

Over the next few weeks, I'll be diving into Python and building out a GitHub portfolio, tackling real world data projects. I'm deeply focused on transitioning into a data analyst role where I can apply these tools to uncover insights and support smart decision-making. 

Before pivoting, I spent 3 years in tax compliance and earned my Association of Tax Technicians (ATT) qualification. That experience sharpened my attention to detail, structured thinking, and ability to work with large, sensitive datasets - skills I'm now excited to apply in a more tech-focused, analytical space. 

I'm eager to connect with others and learn more about the data world. Lets talk! 💬
