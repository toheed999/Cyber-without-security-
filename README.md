‼️The recent ransomware attack on M&S shows that cyber threats aren’t just an IT issue, and can't be ignored. Data insights on the correct defences can help protect companies from serious financial damage. 

🔍 Along the way, each challenge has taught me something new, tackled through my ability to adapt; steered through making the right decisions on the direction my project should go.
