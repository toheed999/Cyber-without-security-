# The Cyber Shift: Analysing 5 Years of Cyber Attacks
💪 The trends in the most significant global cyber attacks can't just be ignored. 

This portfolio analyses the trends between countries in the most significant cyber attacks, ranging from DDoS to Phishing 

📊 One standout Insight: 

While cyberattacks remain a threat, some countries showed a suprising reduction in high impact attacks over the 5 years. 

In one country, I saw a major decline in attacks specifically targeted at government infrastructure - a trend possibly linked to improved cyber defences or increased investment in national security. 

‼️The recent ransomware attack on M&S shows that cyber threats aren’t just an IT issue, and can't be ignored. Data insights on the correct defences can help protect companies from serious financial damage. 

I selectivley chose Kaggle to find my data set. I ensured the dataset included a broad range of countries, types of data sets and cyber defences from me then to decide which areas to dig deeper into. 

🔍 Along the way, each challenge has taught me something new, tackled through my ability to adapt; steered through making the right decisions on the direction my project should go. I worked alongside fellow students on the bootcamp to understand how they tackeled similar challenges I faced, particularly around chosing which data tools to use.
