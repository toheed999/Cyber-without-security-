## The Cyber Shift: Analysing 5 Years of Cyber Attacks 

💪 The trends in the most significant global cyber attacks can't just be ignored. 

This portfolio analyses the trends between countries in the most significant cyber attacks, ranging from DDoS to Phishing. 

‼️The recent ransomware attack on Marks and Spencer shows that cyber threats aren’t just an IT issue. Data insights on the correct defences can help protect companies from serious financial damage

## 🤔 One standout insight:
While cyber attacks remain a threat, some countries showed a suprising reduction in high impact attacks over the 5 years. 

In one country, I saw a major decline in attacks specifically targeted at government infrastructure a trend possibly linked to improved cyber defences or increased investment in national security. 

🛞 Along the way, each challenge has taught me something new, tackled through my ability to adapt, steered through making the right choices on the direction my project should go
